# AGENTS.md

Repository guardrails for humans and AI agents.
This project is a DDD + Hexagonal Architecture workspace. Keep boundaries explicit.

## Scope

These rules apply to the entire repository unless a subdirectory adds stricter guidance.

## Architecture Summary

1. `oneshim-core` is the domain contract layer.
2. Adapter crates implement ports from `oneshim-core`.
3. `oneshim-app` is the composition root and runtime orchestrator.
4. `oneshim-web` is a delivery layer (HTTP handlers + frontend), not a domain layer.
5. `oneshim-automation` enforces policy, sandbox, audit, and action execution flows.

See:
- `docs/architecture/ADR-001-rust-client-architecture-patterns.md`
- `docs/crates/README.md`

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. Preserve dependency direction.
2. Do not introduce direct adapter-to-adapter coupling outside approved exceptions.
3. Use `oneshim-core` ports/traits for cross-layer access instead of concrete adapter types.
4. Keep domain invariants in domain/application services, not in web handlers or UI code.
5. Keep web handlers thin: transport mapping, validation, and service orchestration only.
6. Keep orchestration responsibilities split; do not centralize unrelated concerns into a single large controller/scheduler method.
7. Privacy by default: external egress must pass policy + privacy gates, consent checks, and audit logging.
8. Do not send raw sensitive source data externally unless explicit policy/consent override paths allow it.
9. Frontend shared UI must use design tokens and shared UI primitives for consistency.
10. Frontend text must be i18n-driven; avoid hardcoded locale strings in test selectors.

## Language Policy

1. Primary language for code comments is English.
2. Primary language for logs (`tracing` and runtime diagnostics) is English.
3. User-facing UI text should be localized through i18n resources.

## Change Checklist

Before finalizing a change, verify:

1. Layer boundaries still match Hexagonal/DDD intent.
2. New dependencies do not violate crate direction rules.
3. Policy/privacy/audit paths are preserved for automation and external integrations.
4. UI changes follow tokenized components and i18n conventions.
5. Relevant tests and build checks for touched modules are run.
