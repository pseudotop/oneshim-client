//! Post-install self-healthy probe with 2-failed-boot automatic rollback.
//!
//! See `docs/reviews/2026-04-18-phase4-updater-hardening-design.md` §4 for
//! the full design.
//!
//! State-machine summary:
//! - On every startup, `check_startup_state` inspects `.install_pending_{VERSION}`,
//!   `.boot_count_pid_{VERSION}_{PID}` (per-PID markers; aggregate count is the
//!   number of such files), and `.self_healthy_{VERSION}` in the install directory.
//! - If the aggregate boot count reaches `failed_boot_threshold` (default 2)
//!   without a self-healthy marker, returns `RollbackRequired` with the backup
//!   path recorded at install.
//! - Otherwise returns `Normal`; the scheduler later calls `spawn_healthy_writer`
//!   which writes the self-healthy marker after `healthy_threshold` (default 30s)
//!   of continuous wall-clock uptime.
//! - Staleness rule (§4.3): an `.install_pending_{VERSION}` that is > 24h old
//!   with no healthy marker is treated as abandoned (same-version manual
//!   reinstall or long-idle device). Probe deletes state and returns Normal
//!   without triggering rollback.
//!
//! Ownership (spec Amendment 1 — applied in Task 1): both `check_startup_state`
//! and `spawn_healthy_writer` take `&self` so a single probe instance can be
//! created in `app_runtime_launch.rs`, used for the startup check, then shared
//! via `Arc` into the scheduler for the healthy-writer spawn.
//!
//! # Counter semantics
//!
//! - **Boot-counter ordering**: `failed_boot_threshold = 2` triggers
//!   rollback on the THIRD boot that fails to reach a self-healthy marker
//!   (boot 1 creates marker, count becomes 1; boot 2 creates marker,
//!   count becomes 2; boot 3 reads count=2 ≥ 2 and rolls back). The "2"
//!   refers to the maximum retry count, not the total boot count.
//!
//! - **Concurrent-process safety**: each boot creates one
//!   `.boot_count_pid_{VERSION}_{PID}` marker file via `create_new`
//!   (atomic). The count is derived by listing the directory at
//!   read-time. No read-modify-write sequence exists — concurrent boots
//!   of the same version each record independently. PID reuse across
//!   the lifetime of the install_pending window (< 24h per staleness
//!   rule) is possible but rare; the second `create_new` returns
//!   AlreadyExists and we treat that as "already recorded" (conservative
//!   undercount by 1 in the extreme case).
