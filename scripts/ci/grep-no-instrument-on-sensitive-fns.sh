# D13-v2b PR-B2 — first-line heuristic forbidding `#[tracing::instrument]`
# (or renamed `#[trace]`) on functions that handle the integration_auth_token
# or GrpcSpawnConfig. Auto-attribute-logging of those args would leak the
# token value to logs.
#
# This is a HEURISTIC, not an enforcement guarantee. It's bypassable via:
#  - multi-line attribute syntax `#[instrument(\n  skip_all\n)]`
#  - renamed re-export: `use tracing::instrument as trace; #[trace]`
#  - a contributor adding `#[instrument]` on a NEW sensitive fn not in this
#    allowlist
#
# The ACTUAL invariant guard is the `GrpcSpawnConfig::Debug` redaction test
# in `crates/oneshim-web/src/grpc/spawn_config.rs`. See spec IMP-V2-B + §6.
#
# Run locally: bash scripts/ci/grep-no-instrument-on-sensitive-fns.sh
# Exit 0 = no heuristic violation.
# Exit 1 = violation found, see stdout.
